\section*{From the Editors}
Dear JSESD Authors, Readers and Supporters,

Happy New Year and thank you for your continued support of the Journal of Science Education for Students with Disabilities (\textit{JSESD}). \textit{JSESD} remains a venue for the dissemination of research and practice related to the education of students with disabilities in the science classroom and laboratory since 1998. Volumes \#1 through 11 were published in a print format. Starting with Volume \#12, the journal has been published online and Open Access. Having \textit{JSESD} in the Open Access format maximizes access for readers and authors and allows the journal to remain economically sustainable.  The journal is currently hosted by bepressTM Digital Commons.  The journal’s management and production are led by the very talented group at Rochester Institute of Technology’s Scholarly Publishing group.

We are very excited to welcome two new editors to the JSESD team!  Drs. Thomastine Sarchet-Maher and Jessica Williams will be joining us starting with Volume 26.

Dr. Sarchet-Maher is an Assistant Professor in the Master of Science in Secondary Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students (MSSE) Program and Assistant Dean and Director of the Center for International Educational Outreach at Rochester Institute of Technology’s National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID). Her research primarily focuses on systems change in the global Deaf education context with a focus on: teacher education and policy implementation; curriculum and assessment practices; and academic achievement and employment of Deaf learners across their life span. Dr. Sarchet-Maher has also played a key role in several diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at her institute. 

Dr. Jessica Williams is an Associate Professor and Director of STEM Academies and Transition Programming at Rochester Institute of Technology’s National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID). Her primary research focus is on reading and writing interventions for adolescent and adult d/Deaf and hard of hearing readers in the content areas. Dr. Williams works with K-12 schools to establish partnerships for NTID’s STEM Academies. 

We remain proud of the relationship that \textit{JSESD} has with its partner organization, Science Education for Students with Disabilities (SESD), which is an associated group of the National Science Teaching Association (NSTA).  Each year, SESD holds a pre-conference on science and disability at NSTA’s national conference.  For further information, please contact Rachel Zimmerman Brachman, SESD Conference Coordinator, at: Rachel.Zimmerman-Brachman@jpl.\\nasa.gov.

The journal enthusiastically seeks new manuscript submissions.  We are especially interested in articles on science education for students with varying types of disabilities and at a full range of grade levels (K-12 and postsecondary).  We are also eager to include articles that represent the full research-to-practice continuum. While most manuscripts submitted to \textit{JSESD} have historically focused on research, we have recently seen an increase in practitioner, or “Teaching Techniques” articles.  We are delighted to see these articles, as they provide practical, ready-to-implement approaches for educators at all levels.  We also seek referees who can peer-review \textit{JSESD} manuscript submissions.  If you are interested in peer reviewing, please contact us.


A few reminders:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The journal resides online and free-of-charge.
    \item Manuscripts should be submitted online at http://scholarworks.rit.edu/jsesd/. 
    \item There are currently no fees charged to authors for publication in \textit{JSESD}.  As an open access journal, articles are also free for anyone to read.
    \item \textit{JSESD} uses a double-blind review \\of manuscripts.
\end{itemize}

We know that there is a considerable amount of high-quality scholarship that is being conducted in the field of science education for students with disabilities. \textit{JSESD} is proud to serve as a mechanism for the dissemination of such work. As always, we appreciate your support in maintaining \textit{JSESD} as a quality peer-reviewed journal.
