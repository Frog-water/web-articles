<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Students with blindness or visual impairments (BVI) need to participate in scientific laboratory experiences at the K12 level to be successful in college-level science courses. These K12 level students need instruction to actively conduct science experiments and not only allow sighted students to conduct them. While it may be a challenge, with appropri^ate assistive and supportive technologies, students with BVI can be successful in conducting scientific investigations to address Next Generation Science Standards. The Discoveries in Earth Science (DES) program provides engaging accommodations adaptive to the needs of elementary, middle, and high school grade students with BVI to successfully prepare for careers in STEM. 
<br class="ltx_break"/>
<br class="ltx_break"/>Young students with blindness or visual impairments (BVI) have limited opportunities to participate in hands-on science activities (Supalo, 2012). Heard (2016) recommends that students with BVI participate in scientific labo^ratory experiences at the K12 level. K12 level students with BVI need to conduct science experiments personally and actively, otherwise, students with BVI would be at an educational disadvantage compared to their sighted peers (Supalo et al., 2007). While it may be a challenge, with appropriate accommodations such as braille labeled equipment or tools with audio assistance, young students with vision loss can be successful in conducting scientific investigations. 
<br class="ltx_break"/>
<br class="ltx_break"/>A deficit of opportunities for students with BVI may stem from a dearth of knowledge of accommodations or adapta^tions for students with BVI or come from concern that students with BVI would be exposed to unsafe conditions or activities (Boval and Kennedy, 2018, Chapter 8). Previous work has shown that students with BVI can be successful in conducting safe scientific research and investigations with appropriate assistive technologies and modified resources (Miles Zambone, 2017). The Discoveries in Earth Science (DES) program affords accessibility to Earth science for elementary, middle, and high school students with BVI via private foundation funding and public university support.</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Theoretical Framework</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">There is a misconception that all students with disabilities (SWD), including those with BVI, are also cognitively impaired and this may be the case for some students in this population, but not all (Kahn et al., 2014). As reported by Joyce et al. (2020), special accommodation in communication via technological support, flexibility in scheduling activities, and flexibility in the time allotted to complete tasks can provide opportunities for SWD to learn science. Additionally, educators are responsible for facilitating as many accommodations and modifications as possible to facilitate high-quality instruction and learning (Kahn et al., 2014).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Unfortunately, many teachers are challenged to create an inclusive classroom for SWD. Most general education and science teachers are unfamiliar with teaching strategies to successfully provide instruction to SWD and seek out assistance from exceptional education teachers to best prepare and train these students with skills for employment in STEM (Griffiths et al., 2020). Kahn and Lewis (2014) found that most educators are willing to learn how to provide instruction to this marginalized group and persons with disabilities can be successfully prepared at the K12 level to pursue post-secondary degrees in STEM fields.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Additional challenges include major limitations to opportunities to programs that can support students with disabilities. According to Heard (2016), there have been fewer government dollars spent to increase the percentage of students with disabilities in STEM fields than any other underrepresented population in the United States. Consequently, only 4% of students with disabilities have earned degrees in the natural sciences (Heard, 2016). School systems are not enthusiastically incorporating STEM education into many special needs and exceptional student curricula. The implications of the limited funding and resource development for students to be prepared for STEM-related careers are a) that these students will not be interested in or fully participating in laboratory coursework, and/or b) that science teachers and teacher specialists for students with special needs do not know how to engage these students and sustain their interests and learning (Holbrook et al., 2017). Special needs students such as those with BVI have not enrolled in advanced science courses and have had limited support to pursue educational interests in scientific disciplines.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">As it states in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) all students are “capable of engaging in scientific practices and constructing meaning in both science classrooms and informal settings.” (NGSS, 2013). The mantra “ Science for all” includes SWD to achieve the goals of NGSS. Furthermore, hands-on science activities assist SWD to attain and retain accurate scientific concepts (Scruggs, et al., 2017, Chapter 37). This supports the conceptual change theory which addresses changing a person from a naïve understanding of science to a more accurate one (Lynch et al., 2007). As Miller and Januszyk (2014) also report, a primary aim of NGSS is to have all students learning science and to reduce disparities in student outcomes across diverse groups, including those with disabilities.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx2.p5">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The NGSS emphasizes inquiry-based methods where students conduct science investigations in the natural world (Wild &amp; Koehler, 2017). This includes hands-on laboratory-based experiences which also support constructivist theories founded on scientific experimentation which involves students exploring problems to solve which are meaningful to them (Eliot, 2006). A constructivist approach can promote a positive attitude and assist with developing self-efficacy which can also be effective for students with BVI (Wild &amp; Koehler, 2017; Hilson et al., 2016; Wild, Hilson, &amp; Farrand, 2013; Wild, Hilson &amp; Hobson, 2013; Wild &amp; Trundle, 2010a; Wild &amp; Trundle, 2010b). NGSS also promotes access to modified lab equipment and the shared expertise of science educators and teachers of the visually impaired (TVI). For example, Carabajal et al. 2017, research show that students with BVI with appropriate accommodations can successfully, comprehend and perform geoscience activities. These findings underscore the goals of the DES program. Given that there is a gap in access to science learning for students with BVI as envisioned by the NGSS, we developed the DES program to support BVI student learning and engagement.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">Discoveries in Earth Science (DES) Program</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The goal of the DES program is to provide K12 grade students with BVI the opportunity to fully engage in science. This goal aligns with outcomes from Miyauchi’s (2020) research which highlighted: 1) the ability of teachers to apply pedagogical strategies that are not highly reliant on visual instruction and demonstration 2) effective use of teaching tools, (e.g., laboratory tools with voice output); and 3) availability of external support to meet resource needs such as having a trained teacher of visually impaired (TVI) students with science knowledge or providing teachers that would devote sufficient time for the student(s) and teacher to work together. The project’s outcomes would therefore be useful for informing teachers of visually impaired students about inclusive pedagogy for this population of students.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx3.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">The DES program addresses the low numbers of underrepresented groups in STEM fields by facilitating access to information and activities in Earth science. Specifically, by providing activities that are suitable for students with BVI at the K12 level, the DES program provides a unique opportunity for students in eastern North Carolina to learn Earth science in a university setting. Because one of the goals of the program is to develop the skills of students with BVI to conduct Earth science investigations, participants successfully acquire knowledge and skills to identify and characterize geologic phenomena and engage in research with minimal or no assistance from program personnel. The use of accommodations and adaptive resources by participants is critical in successfully conducting Earth science investigations. We highlight the use of accommodations and adaptions for students with BVI in a program focusing on Earth science.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">In this study we examine participants’, who are blind or visually impaired, perceptions and the implementation of the DES Earth science enrichment program. We pose two research questions 1) How do participants with BVI access tools to conduct Earth Science investigations? 2) How do participants who are blind or visually impaired describe their experiences in an Earth Science enrichment program?</span></p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_font_italic ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">Recruitment of DES Participants</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx6.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Several methods were used to recruit participants for the DES program. First, directors of exceptional children’s programs in eight local school districts were contacted (through making phone calls and sending emails) to assist with the recruitment of students with BVI. Program personnel asked school district directors to contact all the parents in their databases that had identified students with BVI. Program personnel also asked the Section Chief of Sensory Support and Assistive Technology, Exceptional Children Division of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction to recruit student participants. Elementary, middle, and high school science coordinators from the designated school districts also assisted with recruitment. Program personnel also sent communication to the director of the state school for students with visual impairments and the regional office for people with disabilities to recruit interested students for the DES program. Other avenues of recruitment relied on personal relationships with students with BVI. For example, the director of the DES program facilitated an independent research project of a student with BVI in a prior funded program.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx6.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">A total of six students responded to the recruitment efforts, but only four students actively participated in the program. The student participants were all classified as blind or visually impaired and were served by the vision specialists at their schools. Three of the students that participated in the program were male, and one was female as presented in Table 1. Of these participants, two were black and two were Caucasian. The student participants were from grades 2 through 9.</span></p>

This participant was present for most of the sessions during the three weeks of the summer DES program. Ben also continued his participation during the fall and spring semester to work on an independent science fair project. Ben relied on large print font, and magnification to see and read materials during program sessions. He also needed additional light, reduced glare, print on colored paper and additional time to complete his work. Moreover, he preferred to use voice output devices and an iPad to read written information and magnify words.</span></p>

<section class="ltx_section" id="Sx8" lang="en">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_font_italic ltx_title_section" style="font-size:120%;">Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx8.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Numerous activities were implemented during the 3-week DES summer sessions to engage the participants in Earth Science and develop field and laboratory research skills. We intended to collect data on their use of research, adaptive technology tools through observation, records of the degree of assistance and the timeline to mastery in learning to use the tools and assistive technology: determine the program’s impact on motivation in STEM and determine curriculum content, activity experiences, and accommodations that would increase their engagement in science. Additionally, data on learning and engagement was collected through evaluation of their lab notebooks, their final projects, presentations at the end of the summer program, and their academic year activities following the summer program.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx8.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">A variety of factors limited our initial research intent, most notably the late start in funding that made it difficult to recruit a larger pool of participants and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused all activities with K12 participants at the university to cease during the academic year and summers of 2020 and 2021. Thus, while a variety of data was collected, researchers focused on participants’ engagement and as a pilot study to refine DES summer and academic year curricula activities for research questions and design. Therefore, the analysis focused on student engagement after participation in activities implemented during the 3-week DES summer session. Each participant at the end of the day was asked “What is your favorite “thing” you did today?” Participant responses were audio recorded and transcribed. All data were coded and entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet by the researchers.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx8.p3">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Spradley’s (1980) developmental research sequence was used to guide data analysis of the participant-observer field notes and the open-ended questions asked of participants. This analysis led to establishing categories. A classification scheme was developed by the researchers using Tesch’s (1990) organizational system where observations and responses were broken down into units and segments containing one complete idea pertinent to the research questions. Researchers reviewed the field notes collected by a passive participant- observer who only engaged when one of the participants spoke directly to him or her or asked for assistance in using a tool such as the Vernier salinity probe, and an active participant-observer who facilitated students’ participation in the science activities and transcriptions of the four participants’ responses. Neutrality was maintained during our inter-rater analysis as data was examined and categorized on emerging themes (Patton, 2002). As we were concerned with increasing participants’ engagement in the science and their knowledge and skills in using the tools and concepts to conduct scientific study, we noted that themes emerged related to the facility with tools and procedures, interest in science concepts and activities, future opportunities to pursue science careers, and scientific methods and approaches. Data indicating these themes included decreasing time to initiation of an activity, changes to the types of assistance they requested, participants’ questions, comments, and discussions of their findings and their feedback on the day and the activities. For example, the time it took the participants to set up and begin to engage in an activity decreased and the request for assistance also decreased and began to focus on supports for accessing information visually or more in-depth information. Discussions amongst them shifted over time from when lunch would be served or interest in what the adults and other participants were doing to what they were finding in their science activities. Conversations about their school and community experiences began to shift to discussions about what they wanted to do for their science projects during the academic year between summer program sessions.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx8.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Participant responses were categorized as related to either assistive or supportive technologies. Assistive technologies were defined as those resources ( i.e., tools and equipment ) that the students could use independently, with very little assistance, and were designed for students with BVI. Supportive technologies were defined as resources (i.e., tools and equipment) that require instructor assistance or are used by seeing students as is. Refer to Appendices A and B for participant responses. Responses categorized as assistive technologies were the Talking LabQuest Talk 2 Probes and braille protractors and responses categorized as supportive technologies included topographic maps, fossil identification, water level meter, water collection devices at site, mineral identification, rock identification, and the augmented reality sandbox. Refer to Appendix C for information about materials, name of place, and link to purchase memorable assistive and supportive technologies.

Since the numbers and units on the tape measure on the water level meter were very small and difficult to view, the DES participant would use a talking tape measure to determine the depth of water in the well. The talking tape measure was then lined up next to the water level meter, and the measurement was provided through audio sound on the device. The participant then had to record the well number and depth of the water from the top of the well on a “Groundwater Level Activity” sheet presented in Figure 1. A participant also had the option to save the data in the talking tape measure, however each participant was required to record information on a data sheet. Participants recorded data on a sheet where information was written using 20-point font. DES program personnel provided additional assistance by pointing to where a participant would fill in information on the data sheet.</span></p>

Each participant also added a few drops of dilute acid to hear whether the sedimentary rock fizzed and formed bubbles to test for carbonate minerals. The color, texture, and presence of carbonates for both the igneous and metamorphic rocks were determined similarly to the sedimentary rocks. However, for the metamorphic rocks the participants were instructed to determine whether there was foliation or no foliation and banding or no banding. They marked their data sheets accordingly. Additionally, for igneous rocks the participants were to mark whether the igneous rocks were glassy or not glassy and given instructions on how to determine, low, intermediate, or high density. Participants were also given a metamorphic rock identifications flow chart to read further about other characteristics and information of given identified rocks. Furthermore, for igneous rocks, participants were informed about where the rock was found such as in a volcano or inside the Earth.

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Additionally, participants did respond favorably to many of the assistive and supportive technologies, but naturally, there were some challenges faced by participants of the DES program. Measuring with the braille graduated cylinders to determine volume was not as user-friendly as was expected as only one participant could read braille. Additionally, the precision of the audible instruments to measure volume could not measure small changes in the water displacement volumes of small rocks or minerals.

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx35.p1">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">As noted above, the DES program’s summer and academic year activities served to provide elementary, middle and high school grade students with BVI the opportunity to fully engage in science. DES addressed the research questions and design to provide information about access to tools to conduct Earth Science investigations and descriptions of their experiences in an Earth Science enrichment program. The participants of the DES program accessed tools to conduct Earth science investigations using assistive and supportive technologies (see to Figures 1-9). The DES program focused on approaches to meet the needs of students with BVI by (a) highlighting new technologies and (b), refining and revising accommodations to best suit the unique needs of participants. DES personnel were able to provide one-on-one assistance to participants during the 3-week summer program and provide direct individualized assistance during the monthly sessions in the academic year.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx35.p2">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Even though this study is limited to the small population who participated in the DES program, findings are applicable to other students with BVI and formal classroom use. The DES program provided participants with BVI the opportunity to fully engage in science by using assistive and supportive technologies to conduct and collect data themselves as seen in Figures 1 through 9. After participation in a science fair, some participants developed communication skills and a desire to want to conduct scientific investigations. This program’s outcomes also inform classroom teachers about inclusive pedagogy for this population. Assistive and supportive technologies are available for students with BVI for classroom teachers to include in their implementation of strategies in science instruction. The results from the engagement of a small population of students in the DES program show promise for a larger participant population where additional metrics for attitudes and learning outcomes might inform a broader population of students with BVI. The DES program aligns with Miyauchi’s (2020) research which focuses on a) identifying effective instructional approaches and practices and b) providing the participants with supportive and assistive technology.</span></p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Unfortunately, not all students with BVI have access to technologies and teacher instruction as previously described for the DES program. When students with visual impairments are physically in the science education environment, they often do not participate in science experiments (Koehler &amp; Wild, 2019; Miles &amp; Zambone, 2017) Although students with visual impairment are capable of studying all academic subjects like their peers, they are known to be excluded from participating in all subject-related activities, particularly in mathematics, science, physical education (Kahn et al., 2014) and advanced-placement science classes (Koehler &amp; Wild, 2019). Moreover, “students with visual impairment choose courses based not on their ability and interests, but on accessibility” (Miyauchi, 2020, p.2). In our study, we found that the DES program provided greater accessibility to science through the activities implemented with assistive and supportive technologies (see Figures 1-9).</span></p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="Sx35.p4">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:120%;">Furthermore, as discussed in Miyauchi’s work: “ the level of accessibility of the course depends heavily on the subject teacher’s knowledge and willingness” to provide instruction to students with BVI (Miyauchi,2020, p. 2 ). Miyauchi’s research (2020) accounts for this limited access as related to teachers having little or no: 1) pedagogical strategies other than a generic set that is highly reliant on visual instruction and demonstration 2) tools, particularly assistive technology such as laboratory tools with voice output; and 3) external support such as a trained TVI with science knowledge or sufficient time for the student and teacher to work together. The DES program further provided possibilities for students to work together with teachers. Eventually, DES participants gained confidence and knowledge to conduct scientific experiments using the assistive and supportive resources to complete scientific projects. As advocated by Edelson et al. (2021) and Griffiths et al. (2020) the outcomes of the DES program addressed the goals of the NGSS by making learning about science more meaningful and assisting with better preparing students with blind or visual impairments for the STEM workforce.
